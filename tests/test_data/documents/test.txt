Senior Researcher: "I’ve been looking at the raw price series, but the non-stationarity is masking our signals; we should apply ts_diff to the log prices first."

Junior Analyst: "Understood. By calculating the first-order difference, we’re essentially shifting our focus from absolute levels to the dynamics of change itself."

Senior Researcher: "Exactly. Now, once you have that delta, the real challenge begins: you have to decompose that change into two distinct physical regimes."

Junior Analyst: "You mean distinguishing between the stochastic noise and the underlying structural trend?"

Senior Researcher: "Precisely. Most of what we see is high-frequency noise—local fluctuations that are statistically likely to mean-revert to the local equilibrium."

Junior Analyst: "So we treat those as transient perturbations that don't shift the 'true' price of the asset?"

Senior Researcher: "Correct. But when the change is driven by a trend, we’re witnessing a fundamental shift in the system's state—a change in the true price."

Junior Analyst: "And unlike the noise, a trend in a complex system usually implies a break in symmetry that is likely to persist over a specific horizon."

Senior Researcher: "That persistence is our edge. If the change is trending, the probability density of the next step is skewed in the direction of the previous move."

Junior Analyst: "I’ll start building the filter now to separate these components before we commit any capital to the execution engine."

[A Note on Potential Errors]

While ts_diff is excellent for removing trends to achieve stationarity, doing it repeatedly can destroy the "memory" of the series (the long-range dependencies often studied in statistical physics). You might want to eventually look into fractional differentiation to preserve some of that memory while still making the series stationary for your models.

Would you like me to show you how to mathematically represent this decomposition using a state-space model?
