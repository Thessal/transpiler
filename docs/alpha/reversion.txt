* Code:
logret : Signal<Float> = log(signal=data(id="returns"))
short_term_return : Signal<Float> = ts_mean(lookback = 5)
result : Signal<Float> = multiply(signal=short_term_return, -1.0)

* Explanation
Reversion is a concept that the stock price is like to have fluctuate within a week. (5-working day is a one-week horizon.)
This idea can be applied when there is no significant information arrival that changes true price, or fundamentals of a stock.
Investor overreaction is a possible explanation of the fluctuation with 5-day reversion pattern.
Reversion idea works well when the overshoot is endogenous: For example, investor bias, or relationship between stocks.
